# Mobile first responsive ayout

This is my second project for Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree. I built a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. I wrote the CSS to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using min-width media queries, I added breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.

Project contains a stylesheet inside of a css folder.
