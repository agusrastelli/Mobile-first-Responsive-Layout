# Mobile first responsive layout

This is my second project for Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree. I built a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. I wrote the CSS to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using min-width media queries, I added breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.


### Knowledge used
HTML, CSS


### Extra Features
* At least TWO of the following additional styling enhancements have been added to the portfolio: new background color or image, color of a piece of text, additional Google font or styling for the links have been added:
     * The <nav> tag is being used for the navigation bar.
     * Additional section has been added to the page, such as a skills section, and a working link to the new section has been added to the navigation bar using an ID to link to anchor tag.
